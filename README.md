# Freely
#### Mobile App for volunteers
 

Freely is a mobile web-based application that plans to bring both volunteers of any ages, with any interests, and organizations, of any sizes and type, to a centralized platform where they can find each other and engage in benefic activities for the community.

Its main idea is that individuals can find, search, filter and even get recommended volunteering positions for events and activities. They can apply for any event through an application that is later accepted or declined by the organizer. This event application contains details and information of a candidate, such as: short description, personal information and even by uploading a Curriculum Vitae (CV). 

The organizer can view the application and decide if the application is relevant for their interests and either accept it or decline. 

Organizations can also create events, upload a meaningful cover picture, write a description and manage applications for their events.

After the occurrence of the event, both sides can give a feedback by rating their experience through a 5-star system therefore acknowledging the quality of their services.

The fundamental objective of the application is to fix the problems of volunteers in finding something they fit for and the problems of organizers in recruiting and reaching the right audience

The project started as an idea for HackTm Sibiu 2018: [Freely Demo](https://github.com/AnTiDoTe153/Freely).
